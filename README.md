# Iris classification

**Problem Statement :**
The Iris Classification project involves creating a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) based on the length and width of their petals and sepals. This is a classic problem in machine learning and is often used as an introductory example for classification algorithms.

## **Steps** :
1. Dataset Preparation
   
2. Data Exploration and Visualization

3. Data Preprocessing

4. Model Selection and Training

5. Model Evaluation

6. Hyperparameter Tuning 

7. Model Interpretation and Insights
   
8. Conclusion
   
   Petal width and petal length are the strongest predictors of iris species. Setosa is always well-separated, while Versicolor and Virginica are more challenging due to partial overlap.
